# ML_Cyber_Sec_Lab2

I have used data from th github repository https://github.com/csaw-hackml/CSAW-HackML-2020 for this lab. 
The data under lab3 folder has been used. The folder 'cl' contains clean test and validation data and the 
folder 'bd' contains poisoned test and validation data

You can directly run the urd7172_Lab2 file to see the comparisons. 
If you wish to to use other models and data to evaluate, 
execute eval.py by running: python3 eval.py <clean validation data directory> <model directory>.
for the urd7172_Lab2 file, I used the bd_net.h5 Badnet model
